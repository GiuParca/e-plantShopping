## A shopping cart application for an online plant shop developed with React


Main features:
- State Management with Redux: Redux manages global states through actions, reducers, and a central store.
- Modular structure with nested components to ensure scalability and maintainability.
- useState and useEffect for handling component state and side effects like fetching data.
- Event Handling: captures user interactions, such as adding items to the cart and fetching data dynamically.
